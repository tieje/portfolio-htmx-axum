As someone who used to self-host sites on a Raspberry Pi with Docker Swarm, I have a deep appreciation for the simplification of app deployment, development, and security with AWS. With my newly acquired skills, this portfolio site was deployed in AWS with an ALB and ECS Fargate. In terms of difficulty, this is an intermediate certificate: one step above an AWS Cloud Practitioner.","project_url":"https://www.credly.com/badges/a74d35dd-36ff-4272-9d72-b1cf6a6360f5/public_url","github_url":"","topics":["AWS","EC2","ECS/Fargate","Elasticache","CloudFront","BeanStalk","CloudFormation","SNS","SQS","SES","X-Ray","CloudWatch","Lambda","API Gateway","SAM","RDS","DynamoDB","S3","CodePipeline - CI/CD","Security Policies, IAM","Cognito"],"workplace":"","start_date":"Dec. 2023","end_date":"","image_url":"/assets/aws-badge.png","link":"aws-certified-developer-associate"},{"title":"Full Stack Developer","order":9,"is_github_project":false,"github_repo_name":"","description":"In this role, I provided direct consultation for various clients from small businesses to mid-sized corporations across industries such as shipping, medicine, and banking.
